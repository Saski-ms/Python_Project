# Python_Project

The Virtual Pen is a computer vision-based project that enables users to draw on a screen using hand gestures. This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand movements and simulate pen strokes in real time.

*🎯 Features*

* Hand gesture recognition for drawing and erasing.
* Supports different colors and brush sizes.
* Real-time tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe.
* Smooth drawing experience using contour detection.

*🛠️ Technologies Used*

* Python
* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* NumPy

 *🎨 How It Works*

* The camera detects the user's hand using MediaPipe Hands.
* The index finger is used to draw on the screen.
* The thumb and index finger pinch together to erase.
* The system keeps track of past strokes for a seamless experience.
