# Python_Project

The Virtual Pen is a computer vision-based project that enables users to draw on a screen using hand gestures. This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand movements and simulate pen strokes in real time.

🎯 Features

1.Hand gesture recognition for drawing and erasing.
2.Supports different colors and brush sizes.
3.Real-time tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe.
4.Smooth drawing experience using contour detection.

🛠️ Technologies Used

1.Python
2.OpenCV
3.MediaPipe
4.NumPy

🎨 How It Works

1.The camera detects the user's hand using MediaPipe Hands.
2.The index finger is used to draw on the screen.
3.The thumb and index finger pinch together to erase.
4.The system keeps track of past strokes for a seamless experience.
